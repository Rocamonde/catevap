# Catevap

Catevap is a cellular automata traffic simulator for evaluating fully autonomous
(traffic) policies. It has been built to test the proposed methodology and
policies for the Computational Physics project
"A cellular automata model for fully autonomous traffic" as part of my B.Sc. in Theoretical Physics from University College London.
